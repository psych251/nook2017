A Linguistic Signature of Psychological Distancing in Emotion Regulation
Nook, Schleider, & Somerville (2017)_

You will now complete a number of trials of an emotion regulation task.  First you will see the word LOOK or the word CHANGE above a picture and a text box.  If you see the word LOOK, then you should just look at the picture and let yourself feel whatever that image makes you feel.  Don't try to change your feelings at all, but rather just let them emerge naturally.  
If you see the word CHANGE, then you should try to make yourself feel better about the image by rethinking what it means.  Try to think about the image in a new way that makes you feel better about it.  For example, you might imagine that the image is fake: no one is hurt, what you see is just made of plastic, it's just a scene from a movie, etc.  You could also think about how the image is part of a positive story: something positive will soon happen in the picture, or there's something happening outside the picture that actually helps you feel better about it.

While these are on the screen, you will have 30s to write what you are thinking and feeling about the picture.  **Make sure that what you write follows the LOOK or CHANGE instructions!**  After the picture, you will use a scale to rate how you feel either after just looking or changing your feelings.
